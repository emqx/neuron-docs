# Application And Driver Instructions

This document introduces how to setup parameter and data tag point information in configuration for northbound applications and southbound drivers.

**!** uint16 corresponds to the word type. uint32 corresponds to dword type.

## MQTT

The data collected from the device can be transmitted to the mqtt broker through mqtt application, and instructions can be sent to neuron throuth mqtt application.

### Parameter Setting

| Parameter     | Description                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **client-id** | mqtt client id                |
| **ssl**       | enable mqtt ssl, default false  |
| **host**      | mqtt broker host              |
| **port**      | mqtt broker port            |
| **username**  | The user used when connecting to the broker    |
| **password**  | The password used when connecting to the broker      |
| **ca-path**   | ca path                       |
| **ca-file**   | ca file                       |

## eKuiper

Use the eKuiper plugin to stream processing of data collected by Neuron, for detailed usage process,please refer to [Integration of Neuron and eKuiper](https://github.com/lf-edge/ekuiper/blob/master/docs/en_US/tutorials/neuron/neuron_integration_tutorial.md).

## Modbus

The modbus protocol includes three drivers: modbus RTU, modbus tcp, and modbus RTU over TCP.

### Parameter Setting

| Parameter     | Description                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **connection mode** | The way the driver connects to the device, the default is client, which means that the neuron driver is used as the client       |
| **host**            | When neuron is used as a client, host means the ip of the remote device. When used as a server, it means the ip used by neuron locally, and 0.0.0.0 can be filled in by default    |
| **port**           | When neuron is used as client, port means the tcp port of the remote device. When used as a server, it means the tcp port used by neuron locally. default 502    |

### Address Format

> SLAVE!ADDRESS\[.BIT][#ENDIAN]\[.LEN\[H]\[L]\[D]\[E]]</span>

#### **SLAVE**

Required, Slave is the slave address or site number.

#### **ADDRESS**

Required,  Address is the register address.The Modbus protocol has four areas, each area has a maximum of 65536 registers, and the address range of each area is shown in the table below. It should be noted that the storage area as large as 65536 is generally not required in practical applications. Generally, PLC manufacturers generally use an address range within 10000. Please pay attention to fill in the correct point address according to the area and function code of the device.

| AREA           | ADDRESS RANGE   | ATTRIBUTE  | REGISTER SIZE | FUNCTION     | DATA TYPE  |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| coil           | 000001 ~ 065536 | read/write | 1bit          | 0x1,0x5,0x0f | bit        |
| input          | 100001 ~ 165536 | read       | 1bit          | 0x2          | bit        |
| input register | 300001 ~ 365536 | read       | 16bit         | 0x4          | bit,int16,uint16,int32,uint32,float,string |
| hold register  | 400001 ~ 465536 | read/write | 16bit         | 0x3,0x6,0x10 | bit,int16,uint16,int32,uint32,float,string |

**!** Some device documents use function codes and register addresses to describe instructions. Because register address numbers start from 0, the register address range for each region is 0 to 65535. First, determine the highest digit of the address according to the function code, and add 1 to the register address as the address of Neuron.

example, function is 0x03, and register address is 0, then address used by neuron is 400001. function is 0x02, and register address is 5, then address used by neuron is 100006.

#### **.BIT**

Optional, a bit of a register address, for example:
| Address     | Data Type | Description                                                 |

### Address Format

Two address formats

* > GROUP_ADDRESS</span>

Represents the KNX group address, which can only be written in Neuron, and KNX devices belonging to this group will react to messages sent to this group.

*E.g*

`0/0/1` is a KNX group address and is write only in Neuron, KNX devices belonging to this group will react to messages sent to this group.

* > GROUP_ADDRESS,INDIVIDUAL_ADDRESS</span>

代表 KNX 组下的设备地址，只能在 Neuron 中读取。

 Represents a KNX individual address that is a member of the group address, and is read only in Neuron.

*E.g*

`0/0/1,1.1.1` represents a KNX individual address `1.1.1` that is a member
  of the group address `0/0/1`, and is read only in Neuron.
