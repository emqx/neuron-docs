# Script Operators

Following operators can be used in expressions.

| Operator                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <div style="width: 100pt">() Parenthesis. </div> | These are used to group operations, so they will be executed in the right order.<br />&quot;a = b \* (c + d)&quot; will first add c and d, then multiply with b and then assign a with the result. Without the parenthesis, since \* has a higher precedence than +, b and c had first been multiplied and then added with d.                                                                                                                                                           |
| [] Brackets.                                     | These are used at the end of a variable to indicate an indexing of the object variable. An index can be a constant, or a local variable. The start index in an array is always 0.<br />SENSORA[4] means fifth object of SENSORA. In this example, it means sensors number 4.<br />SENSORA[st] means the object in array that the local variable st contains. If st contains 3, this means the fourth object.                                                                              |
| . Dot.                                           | This is used to separate fields.<br />SENSORA[5].FLAG means a flag in sensor 5.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ! + - Unary operators.                           | These unary operators can be used before an operand to change the return value.<br /> !SENSORA[5].FLAG returns 0 if sensor 5 flag is on and returns 1 if sensor 5 is not on.<br /> !var returns 0 if local variable var is non-zero and returns 1 if var is zero.<br /> "a = -b" assign the inverted (opposite sign) value of b to a. <br />"a = -5" assign the constant -5 to a.<br />"a = +b" assign b to a. The unary + has the same meaning as unary - but is also default.                 |
| \* / % Multiplicative operators.                 | \* is multiplication, / is division and % is the reminder of a division. <br />"a = 3 \* b" assign 3 multiplied by b to a. <br />"hour = seccnt / 3600;" assign the integer from the result of seccnt divided by 3600 (1 hour in seconds) to hour. "min = (seccnt % 3600) / 60;" assign the reminder of the previous operation (the number of seconds that was not covered in the hour, divided by 60 (1 minute in seconds) to min. "sec = (seccnt % 3600) % 60;" assign the rest to sec. |
| + - Additive operators                           | + is addition and - is subtraction.<br />"a = b + c - 3;" assign b plus c minus 3 to a.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| < <= > >= Comparison.                            | < means less than, <= means less or equal to, > means greater than and >= means greater or equal to.<br />"a = b <= c;" assign the result of the Comparison b less or equal to c to a. If b is less or equal to c, then a get the value 1, else a get the value 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| == != Comparison (equal).                        | == means equal to and != means not equal to. <br />"a = b != c;" assign the result of the Comparison b not equal to c to a. If b is not equal to c, then a get the value 1, else a get the value 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| & ^ &#124; Bitwise operators.                    | & is logical and between all bits in two operators, &#124; is logical or between all bits in two operators and ^ is logical exclusive or between all bits in two operators<br />"a = b & 0xff" assigns the lower byte in b to a.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

If both b and c are true (non-zero) or if d is true (non-zero), then a get the value 1, else a get the value 0.                                                                                                                                                   |
| = Assign.                                        | This operator assigns the result of the expression to the right to the variable to the left.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Below follows a precedence list of the operators. The top row has highest precedence (priority). Operators at the same level are executed according to the associativity order.

| Operator        | Description    |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| () [] .         | Left to right. |
| ! + -           | Right to left  |
| \* / %          | Left to right  |
| + -             | Left to right  |
| < <= > >= == != | Left to right  |
| & ^ &#124;      | Left to right  |
| & &             | Left to right  |
