# License policy

Neuron is an open source project. We encourage our community to develop their own pluggable modules.

Core framework, dashboard and a few plugin modules such as modbus-tcp, mqtt and eKuiper are open source under LGPLv3 license. Neuron may run with these open source modules without an EMQ license. But all other commercial plugin modules require an official EMQ license to run without limitation.

A trial EMQ license can be download from our [official website](https://www.emqx.com/en/apply-licenses/neuron). All available modules could be used with limitation on 100 connections and 1000 data tags for 15 days. If trial EMQ license is expired, you can apply the trial EMQ license via our official website again. However, a mailbox can only apply for a trial license up to two times.

Of course, you can also directly [contact us](https://www.emqx.com/en/contact?product=neuron) to obtain the official license.
