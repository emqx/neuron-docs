# DL/T645-2007

DL/T 645-2007 is a multifunctional electric energy meter communication protocol used primarily in power systems for single-phase and three-phase meters. It supports various communication methods, including wired (e.g., RS-485) and wireless (e.g., GSM/GPRS). 

The Neuron DLT645-2007 plugin provides connectivity with DL/T 645-2007 devices through serial ports and TCP.

## Add Device

Go to **Configuration -> South Devices**, then click **Add Device** to add the driver. Configure the following settings in the popup dialog box.

- Name: The name of this device node.
- Plugin: Select the **DLT645-2007** plugin.

## Device Configuration

After clicking **Create**, you will be redirected to the **Device Configuration** page, where we will set up the parameters required for Neuron to establish a connection with the northbound application. You can also click the device configuration icon on the southbound device card to enter the **Device Configuration** interface.

| Parameter              | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Physical Link**      | Choose Serial or Ethernet connection mode.                   |
| **Connection Timeout** | Timeout for sending requests to the device                   |
| **Send Inteval**       | Send read instruction interval(ms)                           |
| **Serial Device**      | Only for **Serial** mode, use a serial device, e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0 |
| **Stop Bits**          | Only for **Serial** mode, stopbits, default 1                |
| **Parity**             | Only for **Serial** mode, parity bit, default 2, which means even parity |
| **Baud Rate**          | Only for **Serial** mode, baudrate, default 9600             |
| **Data Bits**          | Only for **Serial** mode, bytesize, default 8                |
| **IP Address**         | Only for **TCP** mode. <br />When Neuron is used as a client, fill in the IP of the remote device. <br />When Neuron is used as a server, fill in the IP of Neuron locally, 0.0.0.0 can be filled in by default. |
| **Port**               | Only for **TCP** mode. <br />When Neuron is used as a client, fill in the TCP port of the remote device. <br />When Neuron is used as a server, fill in the TCP port of Neuron |
| **Connection Mode**    | The way the driver connects to the device, the default is Client, which means that the neuron driver is used as the client. Options: Client, Server. |

## Configure Data Groups and Tags

After the plug-in is added and configured, the next step is to establish communication between your device and Neuron by adding groups and tags to the Southbound driver.

Once device configuration is completed, navigate to the **South Devices** page. Click on the device card or device row to access the **Group List** page. Here, you can create a new group by clicking on **Create**, then specifying the group name and data collection interval.

Upon successfully creating a group, click on its name to proceed to the **Tag List** page. This page allows you to add device tags for data collection. You'll need to provide information such as the tag address, attributes, and data type.

For information on general configuration items, see [Connect to Southbound Devices](../south-devices.md). The subsequent section will concentrate on configurations specific to the driver.

### Data Types

* UIN8
* UINT16
* UINT32
* UIN64

### Address Format

> mail_address#DI<sub>3</sub>-DI<sub>2</sub>-DI<sub>1</sub>-DI<sub>0</sub> 

* `mail_address` represents the mailing address of the meter.
* DI<sub>3</sub>-DI<sub>2</sub>-DI<sub>1</sub>-DI<sub>0</sub> represents the data identification, and all points only support read attributes, and expressed in hexadecimal.

E.g 123456789012#02-01-01-00, represents the value of the A-phase voltage of the meter device with the mailing address 123456789012.

:::tip
Support a node to configure multiple mailing addresses, that is a single serial port multi-device connection.

Please refer to the DL/T645-2007 industry standard data coding table for the specific data item name corresponding to the data identifier.

* The data length is 1, and the data type is UINT8.
* The data length is 2, and the data type is UINT16.
* The data length is 3 or 4, and the data type is UINT32.
* The data length is 5 or 6 or 7 or 8, and the data type is UINT64.
* Set the value of **Decimal** according to the data format, e.g, if the data format is XXX.X, then **Decimal** is set to 0.1.
