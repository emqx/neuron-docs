# Siemens S7 ISOTCP

Siemens S7 ISOTCP is a protocol developed by Siemens for communication with Siemens S7 series PLCs. This protocol is based on the TCP/IP protocol stack and uses the ISO-TSAP protocol for handling connections and data transmission. It enables read and write operations on various data types of the PLC, including bits, bytes, word, double word, timers and counters.

The implementation of S7 ISOTCP in Neuron is divided into two plugins. The Siemens S7 ISOTCP plugin is mainly used to connect to PLC modules such as Siemens S200, S200smart, S1200 and S1500. The Siemens S7 ISOTCP for 300/400 plugin is mainly used to connect to PLC modules such as Siemens S300 and S400 that have an Ethernet module.

::: tip
When using the Siemens S7 ISOTCP plugin to access the S7 1200/1500 PLC,  you need to use Siemens software(TIA16) to make some settings for the PLC.( For detailed settings, please refer to [plc-settings](./plc/siemens-s7-1200-1500.md). )
:::

* The `optimized block access` must be turned off.
* The `access level` must be **full** and the **connection mechanism** must allow GET/PUT.
