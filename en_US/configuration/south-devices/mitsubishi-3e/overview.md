# Mitsubishi 3E

The Mitsubishi 3E plug-in is used to access Mitsubishi's QnA-compatible PLCs, including the Q Series (MC), iQ-F Series (SLMP), and iQ-L Series, via Ethernet.

The Mitsubishi 3E is fully compatible with the Mitsubishi SLMP protocol.

## Add Device

Go to **Configuration -> South Devices**, then click **Add Device** to add the driver. Configure the following settings in the popup dialog box.

- Name: The name of this device node.
- Plugin: Select the **Mitsubishi 3E** plugin.

## Device Configuration

After clicking **Create**, you will be redirected to the **Device Configuration** page, where we will set up the parameters required for Neuron to establish a connection with the northbound application. You can also click the device configuration icon on the southbound device card to enter the **Device Configuration** interface.

|  Parameter      |  Description                      |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| **PLC IP Address** |  Target PLC IPv4 address         |
| **PLC Port** | Target PLC IPv4 address, Default 2000 |

## Configure Data Groups and Tags

After the plug-in is added and configured, the next step is to establish communication between your device and Neuron by adding groups and tags to the Southbound driver.

Once device configuration is completed, navigate to the **South Devices** page. Click on the device card or device row to access the **Group List** page. Here, you can create a new group by clicking on **Create**, then specifying the group name and data collection interval.

Upon successfully creating a group, click on its name to proceed to the **Tag List** page. This page allows you to add device tags for data collection. You'll need to provide information such as the tag address, attributes, and data type.

For information on general configuration items, see [Connect to Southbound Devices](../south-devices.md). The subsequent section will concentrate on configurations specific to the driver.

### Data types

* INT16
* UINT16
* INT32
* UINT32
* FLOAT
* DOUBLE
* BIT
* STRING

### Address Format

> AREA ADDRESS\[.BIT]\[.LEN\[H]\[L]]</span>

#### .BIT

Only available for **non-bit type area**, means read the specified binary bit of the specified address, the binary bit index interval is [0, 15].

#### .LEN\[H]\[L]

When the data type is string type, **.LEN** indicates the length of the string; you can optionally fill in **H** and **L** to indicate two byte orders, and the default is the byte order of **H**.
