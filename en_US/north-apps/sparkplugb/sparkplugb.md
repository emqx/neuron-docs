# Introduction and usage of Sparkplug B

## Module description

Data collected by Neuron from the device can be transmitted from the edge to the Sparkplug_B application using the Sparkplug_B protocol. Users can also send data modification instructions to Neuron from the application. Sparkplug_B is an application-type protocol that runs on top of MQTT, so the setup in Neuron is similar to the MQTT driver.
